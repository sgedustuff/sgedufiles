framework
	- how well, we are managing the project, so that we should not re-write same type of code again and again.
	- once framework is established in effective manner, then for automating any web-sites, we just need to write the testcases and fillup the locators information in object repo.



page model
-----------------
- on a page, there is login functionality, so "do login" is the test case and the elements which are part of "login ui" is "business specification"
- only the way to writing testcase will be changed. Actually it will be divided into parts
	- test case
	- business specification
	** = if in future, if business logic or specification is changed, then only business layer will be updated, the test case layer will be same
- create one more package under test->java i.e. "pages"
- now in this approach, if we have 100 functionalties on the home page, we will not be going to create 100 test cases for each and every functionality. so will create only one single class i.e. "HomePage"


browser properties
-----------------------------
- remember password
- push notification = like allow cookies etc.
- a text appeared like "it is being controlled by automated test software"

********how to configure above things***********
- we use "chromeoptions" class and pass its object while making the object "chromedriver" class.
- fetch the code either from internet or from existing project.

handle element have input's type is file
----------------------------------------------------------
- grab the xpath
- use sendkeys and specify the path of the file along with path.



******Assignement*******

1) facebook => friends => type "friend name" => make test case, that are u getting same name or not.

--52--- (jenkins)


jenkins-installation and launching
-------------------------------------------------
	- download = generic java package.war (works on on any OS)
	- how to run = java -jar jenkins.war
		- while executing u see encrypted password. keep that password, for creating user-id and password (when u run jenkins very first time)
		- at last u see a msg ("jenkins fully up and running")
		- browser = localhost:8080

configuration jenkins
-------------------------------
	- manage jenkins=> configure system
		- check
			- mvn repo path
			- jenkings url path
	- manage jenkins => manage plugin
		- install "maven integration plugin"
		- install "html Publisher"

setup new job in jenkins
-----------------------------------
	- new item => maven project
	- build enviornment => locate "build" section 
		- specify "pom.xml" path with filename
		- goal info = clean test
	- build => post build sction
		- select "publis html reports"
		- add (1st report i.e. index.html )
			- directory name (under surefire)
			- file name
			- report title (reportng report)
		- add (2nd report i.e. emailable-report.html)
			- report tile (testng report)
	- source code management => build periodically (checked)
		- if u want to run this build once in a day, after every one hour, once in a week, once in a month
		- on click "question mark", u see "cron" syntax
			- like = ***** (five time stars) = every minute
	- dashboard = schdule the build = see the console output
		- once executed successfully
		- on left hand side, two things are appeared
			- reportng report
			- testng report
		- when u click either of them, either report is visible or html is crashed
			- need to change the way to run jenkins
			- java -Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP="" - jar jenkins.war (this flag is provided by html publisher plug in)

how to publish logs, generated through logger
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	- still pending on rahul side.
